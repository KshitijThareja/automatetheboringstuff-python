**1.)**
'*, -, /, +' are operators
' "hello", -8.8, and 5' are values

**2.)**
spam is a variable
'spam' is a string

**3.)**
string
int
floating point

**4.)**
An expression is the most basic kind of programming instruction in the language. Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value. That means you can use expressions anywhere in Python code that you could also use a value.
 
 **5.)**
 Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable where as an expression is an instruction consisting of values and operators which is then reduced to a single value.

 **6.)**
Remains unchanged

**7.)**
spamspamspam
spamspamspam

**8.)**
We can't use numbers as variables. We have to put an underscore before them to use them as variables.

**9.)**
We can typecast the value using int, float and str functions.

**10.)**
We can't concatenate int with string. For using this expression, you have to typecaste 99 to string by replacing it with str(99).
