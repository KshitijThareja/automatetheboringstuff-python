**1.)**
It refers to an empty list

---
**2.)**
To interchange third value in actual list with new value:  
spam[2]="hello"
To add a new value at third position:  
spam.insert(2, "hello")

---
**3.)**
Inside expression evaluates to 3. So, spam[3] give element 'd'.

---
**4.)**
It evaluates to 'd'.

---
**5.)**
Gives elements with index 0,1, i.e ['a', 'b'].

---
**6.)**
bacon= [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
bacon.index('cat') evaluates to 1, which is the index position of element 'cat' in the list 'bacon'.

---
**7.)**
Appends 99 at the end of the list. The list "bacon" becomes [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99].

---
**8.)**
bacon.remove('cat') removes 'cat' from the list. The new list will look like [3.14, 'cat', 11, True, 99].

---
**9.)**
'+' operator can concatenate contents of two or more lists. '*' can be used to replicate contents of a list.

---
**10.)**
append() adds the element at last index position of the list, whereas insert() is used to insert the element at a particular index position specified by the user.

---
**11.)**
list.pop() and list.remove().

---
**12.)**
Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.

---
**13.)**
Lists are mutable, i.e,it can have values added, removed, or changed. Whereas tuples are immutable, i.e, its values can't be changed.

---
**14.)**
The value will be given as (42,).

---
**15.)**
To get the tuple form of a list value, use tuple(list), and to get the list form of a tuple value, use list(tuple).

---
**16.)**
They contain references to list values.

---
**17.)**
copy.copy() can be used to make a copy of a mutable value like lists. copy.deepcopy()is used if the list contains inner lists which need to be copied too.
