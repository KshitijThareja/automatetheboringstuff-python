**1.)**
A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times. Without a function defined, you would have to copy and paste this code each time. I also makes debugging your code easier as you already know where that part of program is defined, so you won't have to go through the full code.

**2.)**
The code in a function is executed only if the function is called.

---
**3.)**
The statement "def functionname(arguments)" is used to create a function by the name "functionname" containing the arguments upon which the function is applied.

---
**4.)**
A function call is when a function is called upon to execute over ceratin parameters passed when defining the function.

---
**5.)**
Parameters and variables that are assigned in a called function are said to exist in that functionâ€™s local scope. Variables that are assigned outside all functions are said to exist in the global scope. 
There can be any number of variables is both local and global scope.

---
**6.)**
When a function call is returned, the values of variables in the local scope are destroyed. New values are assigned when a function is called again.

---
**7.)**
A return value is the value or expression that the function should return
When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what this expression evaluates to. 

---
**8.)**
The function will return "None" without giving an explicit return value.

---
**9.)**
If there's no such variable defined in the local scope, then the function will turn to global scope to look for that variable.

---
**10.)**
The datatype of None value is "NoneType".

---
**11.)**
Imports the said module if it exists and is installed by the user or a module by the given name is created separately by the local user.

**12.)**
from spam import *

For this we can use the try and except statements. The part of code in which we think we can get an error is wrapped in "try" statement. And we can use the except statement to raise a custom error message to prevent the entire program from crashing.
