Dictionary has key value pairs, unlike lists. While the order of items matters for determining whether two lists are the same, it does not matter in what order the key-value pairs are typed in a dictionary. Because dictionaries are not ordered, they canâ€™t be sliced like lists.

**4.)**
As the key 'foo' doesn't exist in the given dictionary, it will give a KeyError message.

---
**5.)**
Both check for 'cat' in dictionary's keys.

**6.)**
'cat' in spam will check if 'cat' is a key in spam. 
'cat' in spam.values() checks if there's a value 'cat' corresponding to any key in the dictionary.

spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

We use pprint module to pretty print a dictionary's values. The function used is pprint.pprint(dcitionary_name).
